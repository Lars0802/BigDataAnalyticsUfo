\section{Introduction} \label{introduction}

The abstract in more detail: Tell the whole story, from context to conclusion \ldots\ still high-level but with target audience of computer scientists. Maybe you want to reference some publication, just give the authors of some publication, or give the authors and the reference. Including graphics also is usually dead simple, like with Figure\ref{rubber-duck}.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{rubber-duck}
    \caption{Some large rubber duck.}
